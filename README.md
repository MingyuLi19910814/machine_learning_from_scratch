# Machine Learning from Scratch

This project is built to implement the machine learning algorithms from scratch to deepen my understand of them.

# Decision Tree

The entropy-based decision tree is implemented in models/DecisionTreeModels.py. 
MNIST is used to testify the performance of the implementation.
the accuracy of this implementation on is 87.3%
while the accuracy of sklearn is 87.37%
